ApexKO community tracker
=========================

This issue tracker is not meant for general support. This issue tracker is meant for issue tracking only.
Please do not post issues here, instead [create it in the forums](http://forum.apexko.com/forum/12-bug-report/). Once confirmed, staff will create an issue in the tracker on your behalf. Thanks for your understanding!

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter an issue while using one of ApexKO's services (be it in-game, the website, or even the forums), first search the [issue list](https://github.com/ApexKO/issue-tracking/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search. 

If it has not been reported, please do not use [create a forum thread](http://forum.apexko.com/index.php?app=forums&module=post&section=post&do=new_post&f=12) with at least the following information:

- a short, descriptive title;
- a detailed description of the issue;
- steps for reproducing the issue; and
- your system information.

Conduct
-------

There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions.  While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.

Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with ApexKO.  As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested.  Patience is always appreciated.
